- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucianoRota00, and this is a first read.me document on myself (I am very new to Git Hub!)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning continuously new stuff: mainly mathematical and statistical things, but also coding things are nice ;).
      Away from techincal things, in general I am like a pretty curious child: an avid why-learner! Oh, I also love sports: I am an italian national athlete (mountain running)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things about Data Science and Analysis, Mathematical Engineering and Statistics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for, well, don't really know... So far, my ambition is just to absorb as many things as possibile, try to do something good and enter in a PhD. Nothing else I guess.
- 📫 How to reach me: +39 3484207870 or lucianorota_e@libero.it or lucianorota37@gmail.com
